# Poptin Task

This repository contains the code for a web application that allows users to create custom elements and position them on a page. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for creating and manipulating elements.

## Setup

```
npm install -g live-server
```

live-server
```

## Features

- Drag and drop functionality: Users can drag and drop elements onto the page to create custom elements.
- Customizable elements: Users can customize the text, image, or button associated with each element.
- Element storage: The application saves the position and properties of each element in local storage, allowing users to restore their work later.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- jQuery: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
- jQuery UI: A curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library.
